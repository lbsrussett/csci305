	    <h2>1 Text Editors</h2>
	        <p>I chose vim as my text editor.  When I took Programming with C, this was the editor I used
		so I felt comfortable continuing to use it.<br>
		I watched <a href="www.openvim.com">this tutorial</a> to get a refresher on the different
		commands. <br>
		The tutorial covered:
		    <ol>
		        <li>Normal and Insert modes
		        <li>Different movement modes
		        <li>Text insertion
		        <li>Searching, word and line navigation
		        <li>Removing, replacing and deleting characters
		        <li>Repetition using .
		        <li>Visual mode
		    </ol>
